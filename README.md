My home on the web, where I post blog posts, projects and such.

For 2019 I did a first redesign which asked too much of my time. This 2019 edition, take 2, is much more streamlined. It will only have text posts with no featured images. No 'projects' as a separate kind of post. And Netlify CMS as a CMS (for easy posting.) Finally, I will leverage CodeSandbox to easily and quickly spin up new mini projects.

Other packages and web-things I use here:

- Gatsby
- Styled-components
- Inter
- Crimson text
- Typography.js

Trying to use as few styles for fonts as possible.
