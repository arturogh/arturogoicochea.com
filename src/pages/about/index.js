        <p>Peruvian designer working at Microsoft, living in Seattle, WA.</p>
        <p>
          Build / design with code, through deep understanding, and collaboration. Self-taught.

        <p>
          My personal mission is to positively impact the world. I havenâ€™t focused on an area yet
          (finance, education, etc), and am currently gaining and refining my skills. My role right
          now is pushing my coding skills (React + TypeScript). Previously, I was designing through
          prototyping with Framer. Enjoy big, complex problems. My future is open, and the present
          is an ongoing exploration.
        </p>
