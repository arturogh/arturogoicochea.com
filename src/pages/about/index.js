            Peruvian designer currently at Microsoft, prototyping the future of Office. In previous
            design roles I worked on file creation, saving and collaboration, as well as an
            unreleased mobile app.

          <p>
            Design is how I put together my love for learning with impacting the world positively.
            In fact, I'm a self taught designer and coder, focused right now on leveling up
            JavaScript and React. Am a strong advocate for prototyping from the start of a project,
            even designing primarily with prototyping tools.
